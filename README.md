# The Web Developer's Handbook

The inspiration for this book comes from the principal author's experience of the first few years of being a professional Software Engineer.

Like many people I did not stroll confidently into the role having nailed a traditional Computer Science degree at a reputable university. Rather I stumbled into it after completing an Audio and Music Technology degree (BSc, thank you very much) that offered a couple of modules of C programming.

Blinded by the lights of decades' worth of industry best practices and intimidating acronyms it took me some time before I began to feel comfortable and ultimately came to love the job.

Looking back I feel my life might have been made easier if someone or something could have explained the basics in plain English. I also believe the more we as an industry spend time helping fledgling engineers to take these first steps the better we will do at attracting talented people from all backgrounds into a career in Software Engineering.

Even experienced engineers find it difficult to keep the many concerns that come with the job straight in their heads. From this point of view I am also feeling the need to put down in words some of the practices that I believe make for good software, if only to help formalise my own ideas on the subject.

The Web Developer's Handbook will attempt to strike a balance between these two interests. It aims to provide an approachable introduction to various key aspects of web development as well as to be a reference handbook for more experienced engineers. It is both the book I wish I had when I was starting out and the book that helps me as I progress with my career today.

This introduction must come with some caveats. Although I intend to encourage contributions from other writers, large parts of this book will be informed by my own opinion of what Software Engineering best practices are. These sections may be best thought of as a sort of alternative to a personal blog. Its likely the reader may disagree or find an approach doesn't work for their particular use case but I hope however that the book will provide some useful information.

One final note on why I chose the title The "Web Developer's" Handbook but have been talking mostly about "Software Engineers". I believe that a lot of what makes someone a good Software Engineer is universal and can and should be applied to any kind of software whether it be frontend, backend, embedded or otherwise. As such I would label someone a Software Engineer no matter what software they were engineering. That being said everyone will have their own areas of expertise or interest and mine currently is developing software for the web. As such most of this book will focus on practices and technologies in that field.
